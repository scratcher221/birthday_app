# birthday_app
iOS project

Welcome!

"Birthday Reminder" is an app created with Xcode Version 9.2 and will work on all Apple devices that run on iOS 11.
(Which should be iPhone 5s and more recent devices.)
âˆ‚
It was created by David Mitterlehner und Bernadette Theuretzbachner in December, 2017.
The app sends notification reminders at 12.30 pm local time - however for just testing it out, the trigger time could be changed in AddNewViewController in the function func createNewNotification().


"Birthday Reminder" uses the Swift library SwiftSoup for parsing HTML data from the website https://www.onthisday.com

SwiftSoup is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwiftSoup"
```

For further information please consult README.md in Pods/SwiftSoup directory.
